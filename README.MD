AVASTAROIDS
-----------------------------

a twitter bot thats let u fight the demons and frigging win because it will continuously generate new games until that happens cuz it is just such a nice bot

TODO:
- make it work in node
- make it make gifs
- copy paste streaming redis system from wowwwwbeautiful (p sure u get the avatar URL when streaming events occur)
- *some sort of callback mess to grab users avatar, make a gif, and reply* 
- get more objects for the asteroids/"bad things". maybe word art like STRESS, ANXIETY, HATE, etc. also demons,  businessmen, etc.
- maybe let people @ the bot images for the background? NOT THE ASTEROIDS THO.

This code was originally written w/ [Jack Noble](https://github.com/jacknoble/asteroids) at app academy, 
i was just too lazy to re-write the basic asteroids logic for this bot lol
